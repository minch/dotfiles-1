dotfiles
========

Fresh OS X box? Full machine setup including dotfiles:

```
curl https://raw.github.com/nixme/dotfiles/master/bin/setup-machine | sh
```

Existing box or Linux? Just install dotfiles:

```
curl https://raw.github.com/nixme/dotfiles/master/bin/install-dotfiles | sh
```

_(running random scripts off the internet is lame. thankfully they're my scripts. inspect first)_
