dotfiles
========

Fresh OS X box? Full machine setup including dotfiles:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixme/dotfiles/master/bin/setup-machine | bash
```

Existing box or Linux? Just install dotfiles:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixme/dotfiles/master/bin/install-dotfiles | bash
```

_(running random scripts off the internet is lame. thankfully they're my scripts. inspect first)_
